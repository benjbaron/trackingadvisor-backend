S;Introduction
P;An increasing number of location-based applications and framework continuously track the locations of a large population, often without their knowledge. This information is very valuable as they can reveal personal information about the users and can be sold to third parties that will use them to present advertisement or content tailored to the user’s interests and personal preferences. The purpose of this study is to explore the privacy expectations of individuals when it comes to tracking their location and inferring personal information about them. We are looking for adults who own an iPhone and use them on a daily basis. If you agree to participate, you will install an application on your phone. The application will help us understand your privacy expectations with respect to the personal information we can infer by continuously tracking your location. The minimum participation duration is two weeks, although you are able to participate for longer if you wish.
S;Methodology
P;You will be notified once a day throughout the duration of your participation to review the places we automatically extracted from the locations we recorded the previous day as well as the personal information we inferred from these places. This task takes a few minutes to complete, depending on your past activity. Alternatively, you can review the correctness of the places and the personal information whenever you open the application.
P;The application will also be gathering information in the background (your location, physical activity, battery levels, Wi-Fi connectivity, phone interactions). Periodically, the background information collected and review responses will be securely transmitted to UCL servers. The information we collect will only be used for research projects at UCL. We can offer those of you who are interested access to the full results of our work.
S;General information about the study
P;Your identity will remain anonymous throughout the project – we do not ask for your name, postal address, or other sensitive information. We distinguish participants through their device’s unique code (Apple UUID). In other words, researchers will not be able to link information collected to a certain users to their real identity.
P;Your identity is not the object of our study, however, we understand that the information we collect from your phone might reflect back on you. To this end we are putting all the necessary security measures in place to protect your privacy and assure that your data is only used for academic research purposes.   It is up to you to decide whether to take part or not, if after sending the information you wish to withdraw from the study at any time, you may do so by simply finding the option to withdraw from within the application. You may withdraw at any time before the submission of this work for review before its publication in research journals and conferences. A decision to withdraw will have no negative consequence on you.
P;Please discuss the information above with others if you wish or ask us if there is anything that is not clear or if you would like more information.
P;All data will be collected and stored in accordance with the UK Data Protection Act 1998 and the latest EU GDPR.
P; Thank you for reading this information sheet and for considering taking part in this research.
